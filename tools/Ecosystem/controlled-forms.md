# Controlled Forms

To use a Controlled Form, create a custom component which will return a form tag and override the <code>onSubmit</code> property with a custom function (don't forget to call the preventDefault() method to avoid the default action)

# TextArea tag

The <code>textarea</code> tag in React uses a <code>value</code> property, which will have access to the actual string contained inside it.
<code>onChange</code> is another property available within <code>textarea</code> tags
